# Description

This project provides a simulation for creating string art using modular arithmatic. It was built for my partner (who is a math teacher) to use with her students. The simulation allows students to play with the various variables in choosing how to generate their figure such as:
- The number of cusps in the cardiod
- The number of nodes to use
- The color(s) of the strings used
- The shape of the canvas
- The point to start at
