# NYS Regional Covid Dashboard

## Description

This project is a dashboard made from New York State Department of Health data to visualize COVID-19 cases. The goal of this project was to provide a better view of the regional data, as most other visualizations only gave information by county. The 4 charts offered include:
- Daily New Cases
- Cases per 100k (7 Day Average)
- Daily Percentage Positive
- Percentage Positive (7 Day Average)
