# Description
This project provides a simple grid interface that students can customize to learn about fractal geometry. The grid serves as a way to easily demonstrate self similarity of fractal patterns. Students are able to save their work as a pdf that then can be easily shared, printed, or otherwise displayed for the rest of the class. Students can control the number of grid cells and then paint each cell with customized colors.

## Tech Stack
- Vanilla Javascript (No Framework)
- HTML Canvas
- Bulma (CSS Library)
- Local Storage (For persisting the current grid)
- Firebase Hosting
